# Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49,
# 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new
# list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

b = [elem for elem in a if elem % 2 == 0]

print("a = ", a)
print("b = ", b)
