# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and
# then generates them. Take this opportunity to think about how you can use
# functions. Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the
# sequence to generate.(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers
# where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers
# in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

    else:

            serie.append(i + serie[i - 1])
