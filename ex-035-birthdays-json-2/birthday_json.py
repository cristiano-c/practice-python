# This exercise is Part 3 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other
# exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 4.
#
# In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names
# and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk,
# extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a
# birthday in each month.
#
# Your program should output something like:
#
# {
# 	"May": 3,
# 	"November": 2,
# 	"December": 1
# }

import datetime

    for v in birthdays.values():
        date = datetime.datetime.strptime(v, "%d/%m/%Y")
        if date.month in monthFrequencies:
            monthFrequencies[date.month] += 1
        else:
            monthFrequencies[date.month] = 1
    return monthFrequencies
