# This exercise is Part 4 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series. The other
# exercises are: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.

# In 3 previous exercises, we built up a few components needed to build a Tic
# Tac Toe game in Python:

# Draw the Tic Tac Toe game board Checking whether a game board has a winner
# Handle a player move from user input The next step is to put all these three
# components together to make a two-player Tic Tac Toe game! Your challenge in
# this exercise is to use the functions from those previous exercises all
# together in the same program to make a two-player game that you can play with
# a friend. There are a lot of choices you will have to make when completing
# this exercise, so you can go as far or as little as you want with it.

# Here are a few things to keep in mind:

# You should keep track of who won - if there is a winner, show a congratulatory
# message on the screen.  If there are no more moves left, don’t ask for the
# next player’s move!  As a bonus, you can ask the players if they want to play
# again and keep a running tally of who won more - Player 1 or Player 2.

# Tips Starting this exercise from scratch will take you longer than 30 minutes.
# The best way to save time is to reuse work that has already been done!

# Because you have already done the work of the previous 3 exercises, no need to
# re-do them all! Simply take your code from those exercises, copy it into a new
# file, and start again. Even if you lost your code from those exercises, go to
# the solutions pages, here, here, and here, pick your favorite solutions, and
# start from those!

# A large part of programming is reusing code written by someone else to
# accomplish a task. Sometimes it is fun to write a solution yourself, but other
# times you want to build on top of something else. This exercise gives you an
# opportunity to practice one of the arts of programming - starting from code
# someone else wrote and creating something on top of it.
